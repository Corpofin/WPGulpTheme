## What Can [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp) Do?
 1. Sass to CSS conversion
 2. JS concatenation
 3. Watch files
 4. Live reloads browser with BrowserSync

##Getting Started ?
- Configure the project paths in gulpfile.js (Line #23 to #47)
- Open the project folder in the terminal and type `sudo npm install`  wait for the files to get downloaded. It will take about 2 minutes to add a node_modules folder inside your project.
- Once the download is complete type `gulp` and boom!

##Can You Build Just What's Needed?
Sure! Here you go, it's called [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp)

##Prerequisite & Gotchas
- Tested and built on Mac OS Yosemite.
- You must have Git and Node, NPM, Gulp installed globally. 
- You should never commit `node_modules` folder, you should exclude it in `.gitignore` file.

##Task Branches
- Live browser reload with [BrowserSync](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulpTheme/tree/BrowserSync)
